## ✅ Data Processing & Dashboard Building

I took raw sales data and applied several key analytics steps:

- Cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates, fixed date/time, formatted categories)
- Transformed data using PivotTables for rolling and aggregate values
- Designed an interactive dashboard with:
  - **Slicers** (Month–Year, Category, Size)
  - **KPI cards** for metrics like Total Revenue, Avg Order Value, Orders, Pizzas sold/unit
  - Engaging visual formatting (colors, fonts, alignment)
- Added protection to retain layout while allowing interactivity
